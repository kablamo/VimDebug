=head1 NAME

    vdvim - Launch a minimal vim/gvim with VimDebug development files. (DEPRECATED)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    vdvim [-g] [-m] [$some_file_to_edit]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Please note that this program is deprecated and no longer maintained.

This program is useful for VimDebug developers to try out things. It
launches Vim with the VimDebug development code with no interference
whatsoever from any other Vim module or setup, since it loads no vimrc
files nor any plugins but the VimDebug one (and 'savemap', that is
supplied with and required by VimDebug).

Use the '-g' option to launch 'gvim' instead of 'vim'. Use the '-m'
option to have an existing mapping on <F12> (it will just echo the
string "f12") before loading VimDebug.

Note that this program expects to find the VimDebug development code
relative to where it itself is located on disk, so if you copy it or
move it around, you may need to fix its code accordinly.
